Just a fun little program that has the alphabet snake around a grid. If the snake can't move, the program terminates.

This will currenlty only work on Windows, since I had to use Windows.h to sleep the thread and I'm pretty sure the "cls" command is Windows-only also.

If you have any improvements, I'd be curious to see what you can do!
